        	<h2>Our Online Projects</h2>
            <p>
       One of the most important ways to develop your skills and improve your employability as a software engineer is to work on side projects. These can run the gamut from open source projects to helpful tools and scripts, to fun toys.
       While some of our colleagues always seem to be working on a new side project, it’s not so easy for the rest of us. We want to work on a side project but struggle to come up with a good idea.
        In my experience, this happens when we subconsciously artificially restrict ourselves. For example, we may unintentionally limit the types of projects that we feel are ‘worthy’ as side projects.
        By setting the bar too high — like aiming to create a successful, popular, and original open source library — we rob ourselves of the opportunity to have fun and learn something from a less ambitious, but still worthwhile, side project.
         In this post, I want to help fight “side project paralysis” by offering up 40 side project ideas that any software developer can start in one weekend. The emphasis here is not on projects that are going to change the world. Instead, these are fun projects to give you something to add to your portfolio and make you a better developer</p>

      <p>Most of the members of the Young Entrepreneurs Council swear by this platform when they want to assemble a team that’s both brilliant and qualified.

        A lot of people recommend UpWork.com which is good if you need a one-time gig, but if you plan on being a long-term part time “freelancer” and since you’re a software engineer, there won’t really be a shortage of work for you to find.

        My advice with UpWork is to continuously send your proposals, and don’t think that the first proposal will be the only one that you’ll need to send; on average, it takes at least 7 days for you to land a contract.

        If you’re really good at what you do it probably won’t matter, but my advice is to scatter your resumé all over the inter webs, and make profiles on other sites like Freelancer as well…

        I’ve actually written about how potential clients prepare to look for freelancers, and what you as a freelancers can highlight to set yourself apart from the competition; you can check it (it’s free)</p>
